## 📌 Why This Project Was Needed  
Banks often store vast amounts of customer and transaction data across multiple sheets and reports. 

This dashboard solves the need for:

- Quick visibility of account types and usage trends

- Identifying high- and low-risk customers

- Understanding customer transaction preferences

- Drilling down into customer-level behavior

Everything is consolidated into one Excel interface, reducing the need for complex tools or coding.

This dashboard consolidates essential banking data metrics into **a single interactive Excel file**, using **Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, and Power Query** for easy exploration.
